# Fingerprint-Sequencing

In this system, we propose a method for generating a series of fingerprints using minutiae detection approach for authentication purposes. The system captures multiple 
fingerprints of the user over time and generates a sequence of minutiae-based features to enhance the security of the authentication process. The proposed method uses 
preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of the fingerprint images and then applies the minutiae extraction algorithm to extract minutiae features. 

# Requirements
* Python 3.9
* TensorFlow-Keras
* OpenCV contrib
* PySimpleGUI

# Running the code
In order to run the code, one needs to first git clone all the files from the repository. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal window:

`git clone https://github.com/shaunakmaduskar/Fingerprint-Sequencing.git`

Once the files have been cloned, the next step is to download the dataset. This can be done by visiting the website where the dataset is hosted and downloading the files. 
The dataset can be found at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing](url)

Finally, once the dataset has been downloaded, the code can be run by running the following command in a terminal window:

`python GUI_integrated.py`

This will run the GUI_integrated.py file, which will start the graphical user interface (GUI) for the code.
